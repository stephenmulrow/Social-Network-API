# Social-Network-API

This application is a Social-Network-API using MongoDB for my database. The user is able to POST, GET, DELETE, and PUT users into the existing database. 

This API has the ability to add one or more users at one time, and can even add or delete users by their unique ID.

The application uses Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The application is not deployed, however there is a walkthrough video attached, which tests the previously mentioned routes using Insomnia.
